# Project Description
I have been a fan of basketball for as long as I can remember. Growing up my idol was Steve Nash, and I absolutely loved the way he played the game. His passing and his shooting were the best of his time. Being from the Bay Area, it was hard to not pay attention to the NBA superstar Stephen Curry. The way he played was like a beautiful extension of the way Steve Nash played. The way he and the rest of the Golden State Warriors played was completely different from what I remember watching. They basically reinvented the game of basketball and at the same time were winning with it. People were puzzled by this, and even suggested that the three point line be moved back a couple feet. I wanted to look into this data and see whether or not the increased utilization of the 3 point line was really the source of victory for some teams.
